# Home Experiments: Motor Control

Drawing on the workshop methodologies developed at Tel Aviv University’s Autonomous Systems Lab, this project offers a flexible, open-source approach to learning complex motor control concepts. Through hands-on home experiment kits, you’ll integrate theoretical principles with practical hardware testing—bridging classroom theory and real-world application. Join our global community of learners and educators collaborating to innovate, refine, and share these at-home experiments for motor control and beyond.

## About the Experiment

The **Motor Control Home Experiment** aims to demonstrate fundamental concepts in:
- Motor control
- Arduino as an embedded platform
- Working with sensors: potentiometer, distance sensor (VL53L4CD), encoder

These experiments are suitable for a range of ages and can be easily adapted to different educational levels.

### Why Home Experiment Kits?
Recent educational workshops and research emphasize the value of home experiment kits in bridging the gap between theory and practical application. By integrating open-source designs, learners and educators worldwide can collaborate, adapt, and improve these kits. This openness fosters robust learning experiences and keeps educational content aligned with evolving technologies.

## Getting Started

1. **Hardware Components**
   - Arduino board - Arduino Uno
   - DC motor and motor driver
   - Potentiometer
   - Distance sensor (VL53L4CD)
   - Encoder

2. **Software Setup**
   - [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)  
   - (Optional) MATLAB/Simulink for model-based design and simulation.

3. **Basic Experiment Flow**
   - Review hardware following the [Experiment Manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTPUhsmN9pzYHgXOWRKwX2BtyRtxThCYWmVOfnkxVCWbyEGNXG4-kLLJMpkjMgp8psmi3ngpcFQB8Ji/pub).
   - Run your first motor control sketch in the Arduino IDE.
   - (Optional) Explore Simulink models to simulate your motor control algorithm, then upload it to the Arduino board for real-world testing.

## Educational Approach

### Hybrid Learning Through Home Experiment Kits
Evidence from the workshop implementations at Tel Aviv University’s Autonomous Systems Lab shows that a *hybrid* model—combining online theory with at-home practical work—helps students internalize complex engineering concepts. Students can learn at their own pace and see theory come to life by conducting hands-on experiments wherever they are.
These kits serve as a bridge between theoretical concepts and practical application, offering a flexible learning environment that accommodates individual student needs.

### Open-Source Collaboration
Adopting open-source principles drives ongoing improvements. A global community of instructors and learners can adapt these kits for their specific needs, add new documentation, or incorporate additional sensors. This lowers the barrier to entry while encouraging continuous innovation.

### Integrating Simulink for Deeper Understanding
Model-based design tools like Simulink help you quickly prototype and validate motor control strategies. By analyzing step responses, tuning a PID controller, or experimenting with different inputs, learners see how theoretical models interact with real hardware.
